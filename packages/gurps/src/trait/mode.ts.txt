/**
 * ST (Strength)
 *
 *  - The minimum Strength required to use the weapon properly. If you try to use a weapon that requires more ST than you have,
 *    you will be at -1 to weapon skill per point of ST you lack and lose one extra FP at the end of any fight that lasts long
 *    enough to fatigue you.
 *  - For a melee weapon, your effective ST for damage purposes cannot exceed triple the weapon’s minimum ST. For instance, a // TODO: this triple shit
 *    large knife has minimum ST 6, so its “maximum ST” is 18; if your ST were 19+, you would compute your damage as if you
 *    had ST 18.
 *  - Natural weapons (e.g., a punch or kick) have neither minimum nor maximum ST.
 *
 *
 *  “†” means the weapon requires two hands. If you have at least 1.5 times the listed ST (round up), you can use a weapon like
 *      this in one hand, but it becomes unready after you attack with it. If you have at least twice the listed ST, you can wield
 *      it one-handed with no readiness penalty. But if it requires one hand to hold it and another to operate a moving part, like
 *      a bow or a pump shotgun, it always requires two hands, regardless of ST
 *
 *  “‡” means the weapon requires two hands and becomes unready after you attack with it, unless you have at least 1.5 times the
 *      listed ST (round up). To use it in one hand without it becoming unready, you need at least three times the listed ST.
 *
 *  “R” indicates a firearm that uses a musket rest. The weapon’s weight includes  that of the rest. It takes a Ready maneuver to
 *      balance the weapon on the rest – but after that, any aimed shot fired while stationary and standing up is automatically
 *      braced (see Aim, p. 364).
 *
 *  “B” indicates a firearm with an attached bipod. When firing from a prone position using the bipod, treat the weapon as if it
 *      were braced and reduce its ST requirement to 2/3 of the listed value (round  up); e.g., ST 13 becomes ST 9.
 *
 *  “M” means the weapon is usually mounted in a vehicle or gun carriage, or on a tripod. Ignore the listed ST and Bulk when firing
 *      the weapon from its tripod or mount; the ST requirement only applies when firing the weapon without  its mount. Removing the weapon from its mount (or reattach- ing it) takes at least three one-second Ready maneuvers.
