/*
 * 4) TODO: SIMPLIFIER
 *    The simplifier is a tool that can simplify an expression.
 *    It is a TERM REWRITE SYSTEM (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7540227/strategies-for-simplifying-math-expressions)
 *    There is a list of rules, that contains a pattern and a replacement (regex maybe?). Use special symbols as pattern variables,
 *      which need to get bound during pattern matching (scanning or parsing???) and replaced in the replacement expression.
 *
 *    TRY TO REWRITE EXPRESSION TO A NORMAL FORM
 *        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form)
 *        Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) is a standard form of expression in logic, where each expression is a conjunction of clauses.
 *
 *      Don't forget, that this approach works to a certain point, but is likely to be non complete. This is due to the fact,
 *      that all of the following rules perform local term rewrites.
 *
 *      To make this local rewrite logic stronger, one should try to transform expressions into something I'd call a normal form.
 *      This is my approach:
 *
 *        - If a term contains literal values, try to move the term as far to the right as possible.
 *        - Eventually, this literal value may appear rightmost and can be evaluated as part of a fully literal expression.
 *
 * - RULES
 * - BINDING ENVIRONMENT â€” Something to bind variables to values. Maybe bind any node to a value (like, functions)
 *
 * - AST -> Simplified AST
 *
